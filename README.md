# Exam Language Trainer
This is my Final Project for IT Carlow.
Many students take exams that are not written in their mother tongue. This creates problems for students as well as for exam writers. This project will allow quizzes to be automatically generated from electronic format exam papers. The quizzes will be taken via the web by the students prior to the exam taking place. These quizzes could contain unusual words from the exam papers and for example, using MCQs, assess the preparedness of the students to the language they will encounter at exam time without revealing the contents of the exams. This project must be web based.
